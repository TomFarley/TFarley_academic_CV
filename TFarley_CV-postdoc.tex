I should like to express my interest in the role of \textit{Scrape-Off Layer Turbulence Physicist}, for which I feel I am particularly well suited and I hope to demonstrate why.
I see MAST-U with its unique visible imaging capabilities, cutting edge fast framing cameras, versatile divertor science facility and powerful mid-plane reciprocating probe system as an extremely exciting opportunity for significantly advancing our understanding of scrape-off layer (SOL) physics.
In particular, it will be fascinating to investigate the effects of the super-X divertor and varied divertor and detachment regimes on both upstream and divertor SOL dynamics.

My PhD project as part of the Fusion CDT, entitled `\textit{Analysis of Scrape-Off Layer Plasma Filaments Through Fast Visible Imaging}', has given me a strong background in SOL physics, particularly filamentary transport of particles.
I am already an expert in the analysis of fast visible camera data on MAST and I see this position as the perfect opportunity to develop this expertise further, particularly in taking advantage of the stereoscopic imaging measurements that will be possible on MAST-U.
My existing familiarly with the MAST-U tokamak and its visual camera and Langmuir probe systems will enable me to quickly start applying MAST-U's diagnostics to their full potential.

My work performing novel SOL power decay length measurements using IR thermography on JET further demonstrates my experience with SOL physics, imaging measurements and working within different groups.
My work on neutral beam negative ion sources has provided me with valuable experience working hands on with vacuum systems and performing Langmuir probe measurements in weakly magnetised RF plasmas.
I am highly proficient in python and have developed the large, sophisticated Elzar suite of tools for enhancing, analysing and reviewing fast camera data.
I am extremely organised and believe I will operate the diagnostic systems with efficiency, applying good practises and maintaining good records of measurements, adaptations and changes.
I appreciate my experience with electrical probes is not at the same level as that with imaging techniques, but I believe I can rapidly develop these skills.
My strong record of publications at this early stage in my career, with contributions towards 8 publications and a first author paper in preparation, demonstrate my proven ability to conduct high quality scientific research.

While my anticipated thesis submission date is early 2019, I hope my strengths and experience in the area will justify a later start date for the position.
I attach my CV with further evidence of my suitability for this position and I would be grateful for the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities further at interview. I look forward to hearing from you.

\newpage
\textbf{Describe a situation where you have had to deliver something, be it a project or service, to a high standard. How did you know it reached the standard required? Is there anything you could have done to improve what you delivered? (Please provide examples where appropriate)	}

At the commencement of my current PhD project, a deadline within the group was fast approaching for an Enabling Research project focusing on the benchmarking of a number of plasma turbulence codes. I was tasked with delivering the experimental camera measurements of scrape-off layer filaments with which to initialise the codes and compare their output. I thus had to get up to speed quickly with the project and develop the required analysis tools. I made sure to get clear descriptions of the requirements so as to ensure I delivered the required results. Regular checks with colleagues ensured the measurements met the standards requested, which were ultimately confirmed by the peer review process with which the resulting paper was assessed. This experience taught me how I could improve the recording of data and the settings used to produce them, for the purposes of data provenance and guiding subsequent work.


\textbf{Describe a time when you have worked well and achieved success with a group of others. What was the outcome? What was your contribution? (Please provide examples where appropriate) }

During training as part of the Fusion CDT course I undertook a group project with 4 others to design a hypothetical diagnostic which was not implemented on an existing or planned tokamak. We were located geographically across 4 universities and so had to plan, communicate, share resources and combine our output efficiently using online tools.  I took a proactive role in scheduling our meetings, maintaining good communication and keeping the group to schedule. In the early stages of the project I reviewed possible diagnostic ideas and compared my findings with the other team members.  From a shortlist, we decided the most feasible and effective option was a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy diagnostic to study erosion, deposition and fuel retention in the ITER divertor. I produced a document on Google Drive summarising the physics case, technical requirements and key unsolved questions relating to the project, which the team used to collate our findings and update information as new literature was discovered. This enabled us to work as a cohesive team combining each individual's contribution effectively. We broke up the requirements for the project amongst the group and I took responsibility for the project management plan, formulating the work breakdown structure. This required learning to use new software and techniques and maintaining close contact with my fellow team members to coordinate component lead times and personnel effort to ensure the project schedule, critical path and costs would meet externally imposed ITER requirements. The project was assessed through a report and presentation to which we each contributed a section. The project was awarded a distinction with the highest marks in the project awarded to the management plan that I worked on, which was described in feedback as "extremely     well     thought     through     and     presented".

\textbf{Describe one of your biggest challenges where you had to persevere to succeed. What happened and what did you learn from this? (Please provide examples where appropriate)} 

During my PhD I collaborated with a group at PIIM Laboratory at Aix-Marseilles University, measuring negative ion surface production from diamond materials. I had been allocated 10 weeks of experimental time on a specialised mass-spectroscopy experiment, but on arrival was informed there was a backlog of users requiring time on the apparatus. As a result, it was not until 6 weeks into my visit that I had the planned exclusive access to the apparatus in order to make my measurements. This led to a great deal of time pressure to achieve my goals. Thus I learnt to apply the risk mitigation strategies developed in my grant proposal to achieve the best outcome. I took part in the other user's experiments to gain as much experience with the apparatus as possible before starting my measurements, assigned contingency time and switched to prioritising one of the two planned sets of measurements. The initial period was also used to perform modelling work to better inform the experiments. I formed detailed, structured plans and sought advice from others to ensure my experimental time was used as efficiently as possible. Despite being a hectic and stressful period, through effective planning, time management and perseverance, I succeeded in meeting my key goals. These included fully characterising the negative ion surface production properties of nanocrystalline diamond materials for the first time, eliciting interesting high temperature behaviour. The project had many valuable outcomes and led in part to a journal publication.

\textbf{Please describe your motivation for working at UKAEA.}

I see global warming and global energy security as two of the most pressing issues of our time and the pursuit of fusion energy as a vital endeavour in ensuring the most positive future. I see UKAEA with its two flagship fusion experiments and world leading expertise as the best place to contribute to this most valuable and rewarding of undertakings with the potential to benefit many generations to come. At MAST-U in particular the unique capabilities of its fast visible cameras, divertor science facility and super-X divertor present an exciting opportunity to make unique and challenging measurements to better inform our understanding of scape-off layer transport.
